#define UPLOADED_FILES_DIRECTORY "/home/darshan/Documents/code/netlib(main)/temp_files/"
#define DEFAULT_STATIC_DIRECTORY "/home/darshan/Documents/code/netlib(main)/static/"
#define BUILTIN_STATIC_DIRECTORY "/home/darshan/Documents/code/netlib(main)/default_statics/"
#endif
```

* generate cpp file for your website

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "includes/webserver.h"
#include "includes/public_directory.h"
using namespace std;

RESPONSE admin(httpRequest req, httpResponse res, void *)
{
